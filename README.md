Outsourcing daily tasks just got easier with Web3 technology. Want someone to help with dog walking? Or would you like to walk dogs to earn some money in your free time? Taskify is the solution.


## Project Description
This project enables users to connect with others to efficiently outsource or assist with routine tasks, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain technology and smart contracts. By integrating these decentralized technologies, the platform ensures trust and accountability between users.

The process is straightforward: users can either request help with tasks or offer to assist others. When creating a profile, users will be asked for their first name and role selectionâ€”whether they need assistance or want to become a helper. After signing in, the platform automatically provides a secure wallet for each user. Additionally, new users are verified through World ID by Worldcoin to enhance trust and security.

Once verified, users are ready to either request help for their tasks or post their availability to assist others. The seamless interface makes task management in a decentralized environment both user-friendly and secure.

## How it's Made
This project utilizes a modern tech stack, featuring React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. In addition, we leverage The Graph for querying blockchain data from smart contracts. On the Web3 side, Worldcoin is integrated to verify users, ensuring a secure and decentralized identity layer. Wallet integration is handled by Dynamic, providing seamless crypto wallet functionality.

Task management and payments are both facilitated through smart contracts, ensuring secure, automated processes. For payments, we use The Graph to handle data interactions, and transactions are conducted using USDC (USD Coin). The project operates on the Sepolia testnet, allowing us to test and deploy the decentralized components efficiently.
